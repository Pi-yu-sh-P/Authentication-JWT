# Authentication-JWT

This project demonstrates a simple JWT authentication system using Node.js and a basic HTML/JavaScript frontend.

Resources/Libraries:

Node.js for backend logic.
bcryptjs for secure password hashing.
jsonwebtoken for creating and verifying JWT tokens.
Express as the web framework.
CORS to enable cross-origin requests.

Approach:

Users register and log in through a form.
Upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and stored in localStorage.
Token-based access control is implemented for protected routes.

Versions:

Node.js: v16.x or higher.
bcryptjs: v2.4.3
jsonwebtoken: v8.5.1
Express: v4.17.x

This lightweight solution offers secure user authentication with minimal frontend complexity.
